## Versioning Scheme

We use Semantic Versioning. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for added functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version for backwards compatible bug fixes

## Change Categories

- `Added` for new features
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features
- `Removed` for now removed features
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes
- `Security` for vulnerability fixes

## Release Schedule

- PATCH releases: As needed for bug fixes
- MINOR releases: Every 2-3 months with new features
- MAJOR releases: Yearly with breaking changes

## Pre-release Versioning

Pre-release versions follow this format:
- Alpha: 0.x.0-alpha.1
- Beta: 0.x.0-beta.1
- Release Candidate: 0.x.0-rc.1
